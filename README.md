DooDooDash
==========

DooDooDash is a simple Raspberry Pi project that allows sending a text message using an Amazon Dash button. When the Amazon button is pressed, it sends an ARP request which the Raspberry Pi will intercept using Scapy. Once it sees this request, it uses pygooglevoice to send an SMS through google voice. Check out the youtube video for this: https://youtu.be/SA5eTOCDVJU

**UPDATE (7/15/17): This is currently broken. Currently I'm not able to get the ARP request from the Dash button which should look like it originates from an IP 0.0.0.0. Currently debugging and trying to figure this out. I've tried Scapy 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3.**
